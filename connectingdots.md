## connecting the dots

1. - there wasnt anything that was very suprising to me to see. ive seen many videos just like it that have gone even farther in depth so its gotten to a point of being kinda boring information. something that is fasinating though is just how large the bit integers get going from a 32 bit limit to a 64 bit takes you from about 2 billion in one direction to about 9 **quintillion**.
The best way that i could describe binary would be 1s and 0s that as they each trigger they push the next one to the other side so a 0001 would turn to a 0010 then into 0011 ext...

3. - whenever you type in something like [google.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0) it sends a request to a server for information relating to that webpage then that server sends your computer packets of information to work with one that is the css or a style sheet which has stuff like the background, text color, font type and, text size depending on how well the page was made it can determin whenther it changes for a phone or a differently sized monitor

4. - none of it has really changed my view in the websites that ive made due to us going over all of this in cis 174 and in cis 185 
   - one question that i do have is how much data would it take to completly crash a website or a pc just from trying to load the webpage
