    - javascript is a coding language that is used to add more dynamic features to websites. While html deals with things like the text and images and the css deals with the font, font color and background color, javascript is what is used to make things work better together and more interactable. APIs are kind of like shotcuts that help in the work of making things interactable like google maps so you can have a map around the area of a restraunt on their website.
    
    - the best thing that I can come up with as a exsample is modded minecraft html would have to be the mods on to of the game. the css would be all of the configs for the mods that determin the rules of them. then the javascript would be doing all of the compatability stuff to make sure it all works together and works smoothly 

    - nothing really suprised me about the capabilities becuase I have looked into it in the past.

    - one of them has to do with the APIs that people can make for discord one of which that is really nice is if you change a x/twitter links start to be vxtwitter.com it will turn it into a embed that people to click on to watch videos without haveing to open twitter themselves. my understanging hasnt changed all to much being ive been looking through the inspect element at websites for years to see how things work and what controlls what.

    - the only thing that really "excites" me would be the possibility of APIs. if i where to make a website it would be a cross between something like 4 chan and discord. there isnt anything i really want to learn first

    - i feel like mozilla did it better in terms of explination just because of how they gave examples that you can interact with but they really need to update that page the screenshots a so old (i tried to look at its meta data to find the day it was taken but it was removed) 

    - i think that mozilla also had better information on limits and security features

    - they both say essentially the same thing and they have fused in my head into one homogeneous structure in my head it all comes down to javascript makes websites more interactable and easier to use by adding different features
