    - I dont really us AI for learning to much I use it for random questions that are quite silly like one that I find to be very funny is did you know that a 6ft blueberry would weigh about **7050 lb** which would have about **705 lb** of sugar if its as sweet as a normal blueberry
    - one if the only times where I use AI for something related to learning would be for stuff in my english classes where we have to do stuff like a peer review which I suck at giving advice so I ended up just asking my teacher if I could have a AI look at it and look for issues and things to improve on but not to have it change anything
    - I dont have any conserns being there will always need to be code that is unknown to others for security resons or proprietary reasons which when using an AI every part is known to the AI creator

    - on the questions about if there are any positives for the enviroment Yau Yuan states "AI can enhance energy efficiency and reduce energy usage, and it assists in environmental monitoring and management, such as tracking air emissions. Moreover, AI supports process and supply chain optimization to minimize environmental impacts." which states that it can help with the environment by streamlining transpot by using everything to max efficiency

   > - i thought for kinda of comidic effect to have a AI do the math so here it is
   > Short answer: with today’s best estimates, the “extra” electricity is basically negligible—and at most a few kWh per year.
>
>Recent measurements put a typical ChatGPT text query at ~0.3–0.34 Wh. Google’s own (older, but still-cited) figure for a search is ~0.3 Wh. 
>
>Do the math for 20 uses/day × 365 days = 7,300 queries:
>
>If ChatGPT ≈ 0.30 Wh and Google ≈ 0.30 Wh → difference ≈ 0 Wh each → ~0 kWh extra per year.
>
>Using the higher recent estimate (0.34 Wh vs 0.30 Wh):
>per-query extra = 0.04 Wh → 0.04 Wh × 7,300 = 292 Wh = 0.292 kWh per year (~4–5¢ in U.S. residential electricity). 
>
>Using an older, higher ChatGPT estimate (2.9 Wh vs 0.3 Wh):
>per-query extra = 2.6 Wh → 2.6 Wh × 7,300 ≈ 19 kWh per year (this is now considered an overestimate for modern models). 
>
>Bottom line: with current models, expect ~0 to ~0.3 kWh extra per year for that usage. Only if you assume legacy, high-end estimates does it reach ~19 kWh/year, which newer analyses and reporting suggest is too high.

    - the only thing that i could really do is to stop asking silly questions

    - one of the people that i know used to stream them making art on twitch and so i desided to ask them and they had described artists as a building the higher up in the building that you go the less the AI effects you till you make it to the top then it starts being taken from you the people that it effects the most being the people on the ground floor

    - i dont think that the art itself is unethical i think that part taht is unethical is how the AI is trained which uses other peoples art to train it without consent from the artist

4. 

    - ill used it for just about anything that is completely random or to refind a quote or to find a show from a screenshot

    - i wont use AI for anything that could be illegal or for the lesser of the safe for work

    - because i dont use it for completing assignments i use it to find information

    - ask a different AI the same questions so like asking chatgpt then asking gemini or going to the source links myself

5.

    - i dont think that it is just a hype bubble i think its here to stay it has many practical uses most companies need to stop trying to shove it into everything

    - i think they will stay for doing research within the military there have been tests with them that have lead to more heinous weapons than we have ever created by far

    - i think they should prep for more growth but they need to stop shoving it into everything
