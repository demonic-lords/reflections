not really being i mostly learn from doing things which means that  reading doesnt really do anything for me

variables just help be able to handle the same items over and over so you can do things in bulk instead of having to change it all each time you can jsut it all at once with variables

one of the biggest things taht ive noticed between them is with javascript you can kinda just throw things at the wall and they just work for some reason when you work with a language like C# you have to be very specific about is it a string or is it a int and with the int tag you can go farther by doing just int or int8, int16, int32, and int64

it didnt really help me that much the way that i see variables is in a for of stasus then the stasus is dropped whenever something new need to be put in place
